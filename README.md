# COBOL to Python Translator
## Introduction:
The COBOL to Python Translator is a tool designed to convert legacy COBOL code into modern Python code. This tool leverages the power of LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks and Word2Vec embeddings from the ' gensim ' library to perform accurate and efficient code translation.

## Features:
-> Converts COBOL code to Python code
-> Uses LSTM neural networks for translation
-> Utilizes Word2Vec for word embeddings
-> Easy to use and integrate

## Installation
1.Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/Shreyas-Patil-01/Legacy-code-translator.git
